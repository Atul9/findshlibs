API.

## Documentation

## Example

Here is an example program that prints out each shared library that is
loaded in the process and the addresses where each of its segments are
mapped into memory.

```rust
extern crate findshlibs;
use findshlibs::{Segment, SharedLibrary, TargetSharedLibrary};

fn main() {
    TargetSharedLibrary::each(|shlib| {
        println!("{}", shlib.name().to_string_lossy());

        for seg in shlib.segments() {
            println!("    {}: segment {}",
                     seg.actual_virtual_memory_address(shlib),
                     seg.name().to_string_lossy());
        }
    });
}
```
